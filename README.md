#The calculator.py file in this repository is a simple command-line calculator which can add, subtract, multiply, and divide.

#The welcome() function displays a welcome message when the program is run

#The calculate() function asks the user which operation they would like to complete:

+ for addition
- for subtraction
* for multiplication
/ for division

#There are then a series of if statements which carry out the operations based on the user input

#The error() function displays an error message when a user submits an invalid input

#The again() function is called at the end of the calculate() function to ask the user if they would like to execute another
operation

#This calculator can be adapted to handle decimals or % modulo
